/*******************************************************************************
  Version 1.10 (10 Nov 2006)
  * updated to use library namespaces.
  * removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
  statements as needed.

  Version 1.11 (1 Dec 2006)
  * updated to accomodate changes to stegosystem (move from libwin to libcomm
  and change of name).

  Version 1.20 (14 Dec 2006)
  * updated to use my own image class, rather than depend on the CxImage
  library. This is consonant with the move to use the FreeImage library instead
  of CxImage, and with the long-term goal of having the complete steganography
  system work in Linux as well as Windows.
  * ConvertChannel functions have been removed, as their function is now
  contained within the image class.
  * removed CWinApp parent, as well as the use of resource.h & stdafx.h
