  Data Version 1.00 (30 Nov 2001)
  copied from FilterEmbed - all entries unused.

  Data Version 1.01 (30 Nov 2001)
  deleted strength; kept pathname to allow comparison of extraction to source.

  Data Version 1.10 (15 Feb 2002)
  added embedding density.

  Data Version 1.20 (27 Mar 2002)
  added Codec and Puncture filenames.

  Data Version 1.21 (21 Apr 2002)
  added boolean to determine whether or not we are interleaving.
  also added preset strength value (to avoid estimation errors) and a boolean to
  indicate if we have this or not.

  Data Version 1.30 (7-9 May 2002)
  added source type field (for comparison); added seeds for embedding system,
  interleaver and random source; renamed Density to InterleaverDensity; renamed
  PathName to Source; renamed Strength to EmbedStrength; added bandwidth
  expansion rate as EmbedRate; added filenames for storing results (embedded &
  extracted sequences in signal space, uniform modulation sequence, decoded
  sequence).

  Data Version 1.31 (10 May 2002)
  added booleans to indicate that we want to compute the SNR and BER.

  Data Version 1.32 (6 Jun 2002)
  added filename for storing numerical results.

  Data Version 1.33 (25 Jul 2002)
  added feedback type.

  Data Version 1.34 (16 Nov 2002)
  reversed the order of BER and SNR flags; also renamed these PrintBER and
  PrintSNR, since the user does not really care what needs to be computed, but
  only what should be printed; added flags for printing estimate (usually this
  means the SNR estimate) and the chi square metric.

  Data Version 1.35 (19 Feb 2003)
  added entries for storing filenames in which to save embedded and extracted
  vectors in image domain.

  Version 1.00 (undated)
  initial version

  Version 1.01 (6 Apr 2002)
  added DisplayProgress in FilterContinue, since automatic progress update was
  removed in PSPlugIn 1.41. Also modified the existing DisplayProgress calls to
  use the new multi-pass support, for a more meaningful display.

  Version 1.02 (7 Apr 2002)
  modified the PiPL file to flag which modes are supported.

  Version 1.03 (15 Apr 2002)
  fixed a bug in the user interface by adding "clear" buttons for the source
  file, codec, and puncturing system.

  Version 1.04 (21 Apr 2002)
  added selector to disable/enable variable-density interleaving
  added support for pre-set strength value and also a function to compute
  embedding strength from the stego-signal power as used by Marvel. added
  error-checking of bits where no real data is embedded. fixed a bug in
  converting from a gaussian variate to a uniform one: the function should be y
  = 1/2 * (1 + erf(x/sqrt(2)); the sqrt(2) factor was missing.

  Version 1.05 (23 Apr 2002)
  removed userCanceledError at FilterFinish, because this was not allowing
  Photoshop to record this filter's use in the actions palette, etc.

  Version 1.06 (24 Apr 2002)
  added hook to save signal-space data.

  Version 1.07 (29 Apr 2002)
  added hook to save uniform random sequence; also disabled the question to save
  the extracted data unless a source file was supplied (for comparison).

  Version 1.10 (7-9 May 2002)
  revamped filter architecture; made filter operate in multi-tile mode
  (single-pass); added support for bandwidth expansion; added support for saving
  results (for further analysis in Matlab).

  Version 1.11 (10 May 2002)
  added check boxes to allow the user to activate/disable computing the BER and
  SNR for the channel; results are displayed at the end of the filter in an
  appropriate dialog box. Also fixed a few bugs in the result saving sequence
  and added another two parameters to EstimateSNR: i) a pointer to double is
  supplied, if not NULL, then the real SNR is returned there; ii) a vector with
  the actual embedded signal is also supplied to be able to compute the real SNR
  for all cases. Also, added GetOutputSize() and GetInputSize() functions to
  obtain the correct block size to use; note that in these functions we need to
  round the number of bits returned from codec to ensure that we use the
  required value (was getting different results in the debug and release builds
  before).

  Version 1.12 (11 May 2002)
  fixed a bug in the main dialog - the "clear extracted" command was not
  clearing the respective filename.

  Version 1.13 (4 Jun 2002)
  fixed a bug in computing the SNR: replaced -20*log10(8*dLambda*sqrt(dRate)) by
  -20*log10(dLambda*sqrt(2)*sqrt(dRate)).

  Version 1.14 (6 Jun 2002)
  added a facility for user to save computer SNR/BER to a text file.

  Version 1.15 (9 Jun 2002)
  as a temporary fix, modified FEC decoder to use real SNR instead of estimated
  (this should be replaced by user option, and the estimator should be
  improved).

  Version 1.20 (19,25 Jul 2002)
  included encoding/embedding functions within this class to allow representing
  the channel error back into image space. Also upgraded system to multi-pass
  architecture to allow this, as follows:
  * Iteration 1: extract message
  * End: de-interleave, decode message; compute SNR, BER, channel error (as
  needed)
  * Iteration 2: write back channel error
  * Finish: display SNR, BER if requested
  The type of feedback is chosen by the user: either nothing is written back
  into image space, or else any one of channel error, absolute channel error

  Version 1.21 (26 Jul 2002)
  added log probability ratio feedback, with normalization.

  Version 1.30 (6 Nov 2002)
  added scripting support.

  Version 1.31 (8 Nov 2002)
  modified PluginMain to utilize main function now found in PSPlugIn 1.52.

  Version 1.32 (14 Nov 2002)
  bug fixes: only do a second iteration if there is feedback; do not write
  preset strength to results file.

  Version 1.40 (15 Nov 2002)
  moved embedding/extraction routines to a new class CStegoSystem - this makes
  the code for the embed/extract filters leaner, and also simplifies the process
  of keeping them in sync.

  Version 1.41 (16 Nov 2002)
  * changed data structure - reversed the order of BER and SNR flags; also
  renamed these PrintBER and PrintSNR, since the user does not really care what
  needs to be computed, but only what should be printed; added flags for
  printing estimate (usually this means the SNR estimate) and the chi square
  metric.
  * modified the user interface - added flag entry for estimate and chi square;
  also changed the order of flags to reflect the order they're printed; changed
  the output dialog to reflect the new order; changed the file output routine to
  reflect the new order.
  * Chi square metric output still not functional.

  Version 1.42 (16 Nov 2002)
  added output of chi square metric.

  Version 1.43 (18 Nov 2002)
  modified printing of chi square metric to reflect the change introduced in
  StegoSystem 1.02, where the returned value is the computed chi square, rather
  than its associated probability value.

  Version 1.44 (19 Feb 2003)
  * modified user interface - added entries for saving embedded and extracted
  vectors in image domain.
  * modified data structure to include above entries.
  * modified filter to save the above vectors.

  Version 1.50 (13 Nov 2006)
  * updated to use library namespaces.
  * removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
  statements as needed.

  Version 1.51 (1 Dec 2006)
  * updated to accomodate changes to stegosystem (move from libwin to libcomm
  and change of name).
