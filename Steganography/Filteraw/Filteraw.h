  Data Version 1.00 (4 Apr 2002)
  Original version - contained radius, noise estimate, and a variable bKeepNoise
  to indicate if we want the filter to return the noise component rather than
  the filtered image.

  Data Version 1.10 (3 Mar 2003)
  added boolean to indicate whether or not the noise threshold should be
  automatically estimated. This was necessary to allow feedback of the actual
  noise threshold used in such cases into the data structure, while letting a
  "repeat filter" command to again estimate the noise value.

  Version 1.00 (undated)
  initial version

  Version 1.01 (6 Apr 2002)
  added DisplayProgress in FilterContinue, since automatic progress update was
  removed in PSPlugIn 1.41.

  Version 1.10 (6 Apr 2002)
  made the dialog neater by adding a region size info box (auto-updating with
  the radius edit box); also added auto noise-estimation facility. In the data
  block, this is indicated by a noise estimate of zero (would never want that
  value anyway); in the dialog however, I added a check box, which automatically
  disables the noise estimate edit box. Also changed the filter to work on two
  passes if we want auto estimation (this is necessary or else we get different
  estimates for each tile). Support for multiple iterations was added to
  PSPlugIn 1.40.

  Version 1.11 (7 Apr 2002)
  modified the PiPL file to flag which modes are supported.

  Version 1.12 (14 Apr 2002)
  set the default value of KeepNoise to false (was undefined).

  Version 1.20 (17 Oct 2002)
  updated plugin to use the filter-derived awfilter module, in a dual-pass
  scheme; made awfilter a private base of class; added in-filter progress
  display.

  Version 1.30 (31 Oct - 1 Nov 2002)
  added scripting support

  Version 1.31 (2 Nov 2002)
  * modified scripting support technique: removed scripting.h, integrating the
  necessary elements in the Adobe SDK resources file and moving the key
  definitions to a new header file (scriptingkeys.h) in LibWin; also, we now use
  different SuiteID and EventID for the debug and release builds, and also use
  the full plugin and vendor names within the dictionary (scripting) resource.
  Together, these steps clearly identify which build version of the filter was
  recorded.
  * also, modified the read/write parameters routines to use the new functions
  provided in PSPlugIn 1.51.

  Version 1.32 (8 Nov 2002)
  modified PluginMain to utilize main function now found in PSPlugIn 1.52.

  Version 1.33 (3 Mar 2003)
  modified data structure so that if the noise threshold was automatically
  estimated, the actual value used is returned in the data structure.

  Version 1.40 (13 Nov 2006)
  * updated to use library namespaces.
