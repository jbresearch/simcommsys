  added boolean to determine whether or not we are interleaving.

  Data Version 1.30 (25 Apr 2002)
  added seeds for embedding system, interleaver and random source;
  added source type field; renamed Density to InterleaverDensity;
  renamed PathName to Source; renamed Strength to EmbedStrength

  Version 1.00 (undated)
  initial version

  Version 1.01 (6 Apr 2002)
  added DisplayProgress in FilterContinue, since automatic progress update was
  removed in PSPlugIn 1.41. Also modified the existing DisplayProgress calls to
  use the new multi-pass support, for a more meaningful display.

  Version 1.02 (7 Apr 2002)
  modified the PiPL file to flag which modes are supported.

  Version 1.03 (15 Apr 2002)
  fixed a bug in the user interface by adding "clear" buttons for the source
  file, codec, and puncturing system.

  Version 1.04 (21 Apr 2002)
  added selector to disable/enable variable-density interleaving
  added function to compute embedding strength from the stego-signal power as
  used by Marvel. added support for NULL embedding (ie. sequence embedded is
  all-zero if no filename is passed along as input data). fixed a bug in
  converting from a uniform variate to a gaussian one: the function should be y
  = erfinv(2*x-1) * sqrt(2); the sqrt(2) factor was missing. added information
  in dialog box about raw capacity, usable capacity, code size, and data rate.

  Version 1.10 (25 Apr 2002)
  revamped filter architecture.

  Version 1.11 (26 Apr 2002)
  made filter operate in multi-tile mode (single-pass); added bandwidth
  expansion capability.

  Version 1.12 (8 May 2002)
  modified tile size selector to go for a minimum of one row (to ensure that
  selected tile size is not empty). Also fixed memory leakage by ensuring that
  the codec and puncture pattern are deleted in FilterFinish.

  Version 1.13 (10 May 2002)
  added GetOutputSize() and GetInputSize() functions to obtain the correct block
  size to use; note that in these functions we need to round the number of bits
  returned from codec to ensure that we use the required value (was getting
  different results in the debug and release builds before).

  Version 1.20 (6 Nov 2002)
  added scripting support.

  Version 1.21 (8 Nov 2002)
  modified PluginMain to utilize main function now found in PSPlugIn 1.52.

  Version 1.30 (15 Nov 2002)
  moved embedding/extraction routines to a new class CStegoSystem - this makes
  the code for the embed/extract filters leaner, and also simplifies the process
  of keeping them in sync.

  Version 1.40 (13 Nov 2006)
  * updated to use library namespaces.
  * removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
  statements as needed.

  Version 1.41 (1 Dec 2006)
  * updated to accomodate changes to stegosystem (move from libwin to libcomm
  and change of name).
