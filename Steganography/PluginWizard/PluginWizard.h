// See PluginWizard.cpp for the implementation of this class

/*
  Version 1.01 (6 Apr 2002)
  modified file-processing loop to skip the last line (since this was probably
  adding an extra blank line at the end of the output files).

  Version 1.10 (1 Nov 2002)
  modified the list of files to be processed - instead of a static list, we now
  find all files matching a fixed set of extensions (cpp, h, dsp, r, rc). This
  was felt necessary because some filters have more files than the standard
  MFCShell set (notably with the introduction of scripting support).

  Version 1.20 (13 Nov 2006)
  * updated to use library namespaces.
  * removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
  statements as needed.
