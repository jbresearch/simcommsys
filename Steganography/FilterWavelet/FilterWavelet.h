/*
  Data Version 1.01 (28 Nov 2001)
  added variable bKeepNoise to indicate if we want the filter to return the
  noise component rather than the filtered image.

  Data Version 1.10 (2 Dec 2001)
  added tile width and height sizes.

  Data Version 1.11 (21 Apr 2002)
  added thresholding type (ie. hard and soft)

  Data Version 1.12 (29 Apr 2002)
  renamed data members and organized them better; added threshold selector
  member; added boolean to indicate whole-image tiling (useful for multi-file
  processing).

  Data Version 1.13 (30 Apr 2002)
  added wavelet parameter variable (used to determine the length / number of
  vanishing moments, etc. for the specified wavelet type).

  Version 1.00 (undated)
  initial version

  Version 1.01 (6 Apr 2002)
  added DisplayProgress in FilterContinue, since automatic progress update was
  removed in PSPlugIn 1.41.

  Version 1.02 (7 Apr 2002)
  modified the PiPL file to flag which modes are supported.

  Version 1.03 (12 Apr 2002)
  modified dialog to include a check box to apply filter to whole image at once,
  rather than the suggested tile size.

  Version 1.04 (14 Apr 2002)
  modified dialog box display function so that "whole image" is checked even if
  last tile size was _exactly_ equal to the image size.

  Version 1.10 (15-16 Apr 2002)
  updated plugin to use the revamped waveletfilter module, in a dual-pass
  scheme.

  Version 1.11 (21 Apr 2002)
  added choice between hard and soft thresholding.

  Version 1.20 (29 Apr 2002)
  cleaned up user interface & renamed data members; made waveletfilter a private
  base of class; added visu threshold selection and paved the way for other
  threshold selectors; added in-filter progress display.

  Version 1.30 (30 Apr 2002)
  added support for Haar, Beylkin, Coiflet, Daubechies, Symmlet, Vaidyanathan,
  and Battle-Lemarie wavelets with a number of parameters for each, as in
  wavelet 1.30.

  Version 1.31 (17 Oct 2002)
  fixed a minor bug (performance enhancement only) - limiter process is now only
  done twice if KeepNoise was true.

  Version 1.40 (6 Nov 2002)
  added scripting support; also changed FilterStart to check bWholeImage before
  setting the tile width (before this was only done in ShowDialog, which meant
  [bug] that if the user ran the filter again with WholeImage on a new image
  without ShowDialog, then the old tile size would be used). Also, modified
  FilterStart to first call the base class's FilterStart, then change the tile
  size, and then call IterationStart again to set the new tile sizes.

  Version 1.41 (8 Nov 2002)
  modified PluginMain to utilize main function now found in PSPlugIn 1.52.

  Version 1.50 (13 Nov 2006)
  * updated to use library namespaces.
