 Version 1.00 (11 Nov 2001)
 Initial version.

 Version 1.01 (6 Mar 2002)
 changed vcs version variable from a global to a static class variable.

 Version 1.02 (14 Mar 2002)
 reorganized implementation file; made destructor inline.

 Version 1.10 (15 Apr 2002)
 class is now derived from filter. Also fixed a couple bugs in the thresholding
 process while doing the conversion:
 * when finding the threshold from the histogram I was (probably - the histogram
 classes are a little messy & need to be updated/changed/removed) only
 considering the positive coefficients; now I work on the absolute values.
 * for a transform where the lower (xlimit,ylimit) coefficients are the
 low-frequency ones, only the coefficients at x>xlimit, y>ylimit were being
 shrunk. This is not the same as "all high-frequency coeffs", and was
 introducing some artifacts. It is now fixed.

 Version 1.11 (21 Apr 2002)
 added soft thresholding.

 Version 1.20 (29 Apr 2002)
 renamed internal variables; added visu threshold selection & paved the way for
 other selectors; added progress display routine in conformance with
 filter 1.10. also fixed a bug in % cutoff method - was computing %age on sorted
 list of coefficients and not on their absolute values, as it should be.

 Version 1.30 (30 Apr 2002)
 added support for Haar, Beylkin, Coiflet, Daubechies, Symmlet, Vaidyanathan,
 and Battle-Lemarie wavelets with a number of parameters for each, as in
 wavelet 1.30.

 Version 1.31 (13 Oct 2006)
 * added explicit conversion to int in round's output in estimate().
 * added explicit parameter conversion to double for log in estimate().

 Version 1.40 (10 Nov 2006)
 * defined class and associated data within "libimage" namespace.
 * removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using" statements
 as needed.
