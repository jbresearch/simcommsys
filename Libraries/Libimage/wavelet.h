/*
 Version 1.00 (6 Jun 2000)
 Initial version - uses Daub4 wavelets and does single and 2-dimensional
 transforms and inverses.

 Version 1.10 (11 Nov 2001)
 Added number of levels to be performed for transform & inverse, and a public
 function that allows the user to find the size of the low-freq coefficients
 with that level

 Version 1.11 (6 Mar 2002)
 changed vcs version variable from a global to a static class variable.
 also changed use of iostream from global to std namespace.
 edited the classes to be compileable with Microsoft extensions enabled - in
 practice, the major change is in for() loops, where MS defines scope
 differently from ANSI. Here we chose to take the loop variables into function
 scope.

 Version 1.12 (13 Apr 2002)
 modified transform and inverse to make use of new row/col insert/extract
 functions in matrix.

 Version 1.13 (14 Apr 2002)
 reorganized implementation file; made destructor virtual inline; made
 quadrature a static function; changed error-displays to assert statements.

 Version 1.20 (15 Apr 2002)
 changed the external and internal transform/inverse functions to allow the user
 to specify both an input and an output vector/matrix. This allows us easily to
 keep the input data if we want; otherwise, the user can always specify both to
 be the same (the algorithm allows this). Also commented out the
 translation-invariant partial transform function since we're not using that at
 the moment anyway.

 Version 1.30 (30 Apr 2002)
 added support for Haar, Beylkin, Coiflet, Daubechies, Symmlet, Vaidyanathan,
 and Battle-Lemarie wavelets with a number of parameters for each. Also added
 support for default construction and later initialization.

 Version 1.40 (10 Nov 2006)
 * defined class and associated data within "libimage" namespace.
 * removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using" statements
 as needed.
