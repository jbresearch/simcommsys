 * \brief   Knuth's Subtractive Random Generator.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * A pseudo-random generator using the subtractive technique due to
 * Knuth. This algorithm was found to give very good results in the
 * communications lab during the third year.
 *
 * \note
 * - The subtractive algorithm has a very long period (necessary for low
 * bit error rates in the tested data stream)
 * - It also does not suffer from low-order correlations (facilitating its
 * use with a variable number of bits/code in the data stream)
