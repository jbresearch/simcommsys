/*!
 * \brief   Bitstream File-handling.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * \version 1.01 (27 Nov 2001)
 * added a function which returns the number of bits left in the buffer for
 * ifbstream. Also made eof, fail, bad, good, all const functions. Also made the
 * filename for open and creator functions (const char *).
 *
 * \version 1.02 (30 Nov 2001)
 * edited write/read buffer routines - now read will only get 8 bits at a time,
 * and write will only output as many characters as necessary to eject the
 * buffer.
 *
 * \version 1.03 (3 Dec 2001)
 * fixed opening of bitstream files - now they are opened as binary files.
 *
 * \version 1.04 (6 Mar 2002)
 * changed vcs version variable from a global to a static class variable.
 * also changed use of iostream from global to std namespace.
 *
 * \version 1.10 (26 Oct 2006)
 * - defined class and associated data within "libbase" namespace.
 * - removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
 * statements as needed.
