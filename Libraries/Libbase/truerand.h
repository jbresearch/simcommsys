/*!
 * \brief   True Random Number Generator.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * Provide "true" random numbers, through OS routines. This was originally
 * created to facilitate seeding slave workers with independent seeds.
 * The random source used is a non-blocking cryptographically secure PRNG,
 * regularly re-seeded from entropy sources available to the kernel.
 * Specifically:
 * - Win32 support provided through CryptoAPI
 * - UNIX support provided through /dev/urandom
 *
 * \note Idea suggested by Vangelis Koukis <vkoukis@cslab.ece.ntua.gr>
