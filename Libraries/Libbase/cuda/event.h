 * \brief   A CUDA event
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * This class represents an identifier for an event on a stream. An event has
 * occurred when all other preceding commands on the same stream have completed.
 * This can be used to set dependencies between streams.
 *
 * Note that this is a host-only object. Device code has no interface to events.
