/*!
 * \brief   MPI Multi-Computer Environment.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * \version 1.01 (5 Mar 1999)
 * updated mpi child functions to print the latency between jobs.
 *
 * \version 2.00 (23 Mar 1999)
 * major update to the class.
 *
 * \version 2.10 (25 Mar 1999)
 * changed the spawning algorithm. Now, this will spawn max*nodes processes, so
 * that all processors are necessarily covered. Then, it will kill unnecessary
 * nodes to avoid memory wastage. Note that with this technique, there is no
 * more the need to have the nodes sorted in order of decreasing processors.
 * Also, all nodes are cleanly in a single communicator, which aviods playing
 * about with MPI. Also changed the initialisation process of children. Now
 * children enter the loop immediately and must explicitly directed to send the
 * number of processors to root or to get the size/rank.
 *
 * \version 2.11 (7 May 1999)
 * re-schedules children with a lower priority to favour foreground tasks.
 *
 * \version 2.12 (22 Jul 1999)
 * prints CPU usage information at the end of the process.
 *
 * \version 2.13 (3 Sep 1999)
 * added functions for children to send integers to the root process
 *
 * \version 2.20 (29 Sep 2001)
 * modified to compile on Win32 as a Dummy MPI module
 *
 * \version 2.21 (23 Feb 2002)
 * added flushes to all end-of-line clog outputs, to clean up text user
 * interface.
 *
 * \version 2.22 (6 Mar 2002)
 * changed vcs version variable from a global to a static class variable.
 * also changed use of iostream from global to std namespace.
 *
 * \version 2.30 (26 Jul 2006)
 * first attempt to get this to work with OpenMPI as installed on iapetus
 * (should be a recent version as it has just been installed for me, but I do
 * not yet know how to determine the version number).
 * - made as much code unconditional as possible (instead of depending on the
 * definition of MPI, which was conflicting with the namespace)
 * - reworked the parent/child relationship to avoid spawning - modern-day
 * libaries seem to handle multi-CPU machines with ease, and this greatly
 * simplifies the code.
 * - removed dependence on environment variables 'CPUS' and 'HOSTNAME'
 *
 * \version 2.31 (27 Jul 2006)
 * updated class:
 * - to revert to non-MPI mode when the "cluster" consists of a single node.
 * - to alleviate typos, the 'initialised' variable has been americanized.
 * - the 'rank()' function is now also scaled down to ignore the root process.
 * - CPU usage is returned as type double instead of integer (for each child)
 * - total usage is kept as a private member and updated at the end; this can be
 * read by the user with the appropriate function.
 *
 * \version 2.40 (26 Oct 2006)
 * - defined class and associated data within "libbase" namespace.
 * - removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
 * statements as needed.
 *
 * \version 2.41 (28 Sep 2007)
 * modified so that compilation as a Dummy MPI module occurs when USEMPI is not
 * defined.
