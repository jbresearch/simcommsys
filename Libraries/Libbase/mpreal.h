/*!
 * \brief   Multi-Precision Arithmetic.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * \version 1.01 (6 Mar 2002)
 * changed vcs version variable from a global to a static class variable.
 * also changed use of iostream from global to std namespace.
 *
 * \version 1.02 (15 Jun 2002)
 * - changed all pow() functions to more accurately specify that we want to
 * call double pow(double, int)
 * - changed 'flags' variable in implementation file from type int to type
 * ios::fmtflags, as it's supposed to be.
 *
 * \version 1.10 (26 Oct 2006)
 * - defined class and associated data within "libbase" namespace.
 * - removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
 * statements as needed.
 *
 * \version 1.11 (17 Jul 2007)
 * - changed references to isinf() and isnan() back to global namespace, in
 * accord with config.h 3.23.
