 * \brief   Event time-keeper.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * This class is used to gather statistics on events, automatically printing
 * these statistics when the object goes out of scope. This makes it easy to
 * print data over multiple calls of a method, by creating a static object
 * within the method itself.
 *
 * The class takes one template argument, for the type of timer to use. This
 * allows the use of CPU or other embedded timers (such as GPU timers). The
 * timer must provide start(), stop(), and elapsed() methods.
