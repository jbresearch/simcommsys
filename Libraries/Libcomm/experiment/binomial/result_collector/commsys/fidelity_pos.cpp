 * \param[in]  act_drift  Actual drift positions
 * \param[in]  est_drift  Estimated drift positions
 *
 * Results are organized as (symbol,frame) error count, repeated for
 * every iteration that needs to be performed. Eventually these will be
 * divided by the respective multiplicity to get the average error rates.
