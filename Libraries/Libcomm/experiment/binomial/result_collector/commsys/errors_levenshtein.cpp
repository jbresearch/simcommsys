 * \brief Update result set
 * \param[out] result   Vector containing the set of results to be updated
 * \param[in]  source   Source data sequence
 * \param[in]  decoded  Decoded data sequence
 *
 * Results are organized as (symbol_hamming, symbol_levenshtein,frame)
 * error count, repeated for every iteration that needs to be performed.
 * Eventually these will be divided by the respective multiplicity to get the
 * average error rates.
