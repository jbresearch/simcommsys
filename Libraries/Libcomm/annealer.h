/*!
 * \brief   Simulated Annealing Algorithm.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * \version 1.01 (10 Oct 2001)
 * added a virtual display function, to facilitate deriving from the class to produce a
 * windowed GUI (by using custom display routines), and also added a virtual interrupt
 * function to allow a derived class to stop the processing routine. Both functions are
 * protected so they can only be called by the class itself or by derived classes.
 *
 * \version 1.02 (16 Nov 2001)
 * added a virtual destructor.
 *
 * \version 1.03 (23 Feb 2002)
 * added flushes to all end-of-line clog outputs, to clean up text user interface.
 *
 * \version 1.04 (6 Mar 2002)
 * changed vcs version variable from a global to a static class variable.
 * also changed use of iostream from global to std namespace.
 *
 * \version 1.10 (27 Oct 2006)
 * - defined class and associated data within "libcomm" namespace.
 * - removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using" statements as needed.
