/*!
 * \brief   Simulated Annealing System base.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * \version 1.00 (10 Jul 1998)
 *
 * \version 1.10 (11 Oct 2001)
 * added a virtual function which outputs the annealed system
 * (this was only done before in the destruction mechanism)
 *
 * \version 1.11 (26 Oct 2001)
 * added a virtual destroy function (see interleaver.h)
 *
 * \version 1.20 (4 Nov 2001)
 * added a stream << operator and modified the regular output routine
 * accordingly (so that this now returns the stream, and is a pure virtual).
 *
 * \version 1.21 (6 Mar 2002)
 * changed vcs version variable from a global to a static class variable.
 * also changed use of iostream from global to std namespace.
 *
 * \version 1.22 (17 Jul 2006)
 * added virtual destructor, since this is not done by default.
 *
 * \version 1.23 (25 Jul 2006)
 * added empty definition for virtual destructor.
 *
 * \version 1.30 (27 Oct 2006)
 * - defined class and associated data within "libcomm" namespace.
 * - removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
 * statements as needed.
