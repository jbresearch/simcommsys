 * \brief   Simulated Annealing Interleaver Design.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * \version 1.00
 * Six different energy functions were used, as detailed in my Feb 1 report "On
 * the importance of the interleaver in parallel concatenated turbo codes".
 *
 * \version 1.10
 * Removed the bug mentioned in the report (affecting the range of j) for type 5
 * function [type 7]
 *
 * \version 1.20
 * Removed the restriction on the positions to swap for correct tailing (ie. use
 * as untailed) [type 8] also speeded up annealing by introducing the delta
 * function (optimised)
 *
 * \version 1.30 (27 Apr 1999)
 * New energy function [type 9]: SUM of 5*m/r
 *
 * \version 1.40 (28 Apr 1999)
 * New energy function [type 10]: SUM of ( (tau*sqrt(2) - r)/(tau*sqrt(2)) ) ^ 4
 *
 * \version 1.50 (30 Apr 1999)
 * Changed energy function [type 11]: basically same as type 9, but corrected
 * for annulus area
 *
 * \version 1.60 (3 May 1999)
 * New energy function [type 12]: still using corrected weighting, but now we
 * have a function that is symmetric across the valid range of r
 *
 * \version 1.70 (6 May 1999)
 * New energy function [type 13]: same as type 9, but corrected for 'flat'
 * distribution
 *
 * \version 2.00 (25 May 1999)
 * Integrated different energy functions into a single class, user selected at
 * creation. Also, on creation, the LUT is randomised.
 *
 * \version 2.10 (28 Sep 1999)
 * Added support for self-terminating interleavers.
 *
 * \version 2.20 (2 Oct 1999)
 * New energy function [type 14]: SUM of log(l_in + l_out) where the two lengths
 * are the lengths of the zero sequences in the parity for input and interleaved
 * sequences, based on the impulse response of the encoder.
 *
 * \version 3.00 (12 Mar 2000)
 * Extended the annealer to support multi-dimensional interleavers, while
 * keeping compatibility and support for all old 2D interleaver types. New
 * energy function [type 15] implements the same thing as type 9 but scaled to
 * multi-dimensions.
 *
 * \version 3.01 (15 Mar 2001)
 * Allowed the setting of the random seed during creation.
 *
 * \version 3.10 (11 Oct 2001)
 * added a virtual function which outputs the annealed system (this was only
 * done before in the destruction mechanism), in accordance with
 * anneal_system 1.10
 *
 * \version 3.20 (2 Nov 2001)
 * Modified energy function - rather than working delta and then returning the
 * value when the end of the function is reached, we now return the delta energy
 * immediately. Should be slightly more efficient, and makes the creation of
 * more complex energy functions easier. Also created new energy function [type
 * 16].
 *
 * \version 3.21 (4 Nov 2001)
 * modified the stream output function in accordance with anneal_system 1.20
 *
 * \version 3.22 (26 Feb 2002)
 * removed the automatic printing feature at destruction.
 *
 * \version 3.23 (1 Mar 2002)
 * edited the classes to be compileable with Microsoft extensions enabled - in
 * practice, the major change is in for() loops, where MS defines scope
 * differently from ANSI. Rather than taking the loop variables into function
 * scope, we chose to avoid having more than one loop per function, by defining
 * private helper functions.
 *
 * \version 3.24 (6 Mar 2002)
 * changed vcs version variable from a global to a static class variable.
 * also changed use of iostream from global to std namespace.
 *
 * \version 3.25 (11-12 Jun 2002)
 * - added "algorithm" to supply the definition of the swap() function (which
 * has been removed from config).
 * - moved the (empty) destructor to the definition file.
 *
 * \version 3.26 (6 Oct 2006)
 * modified for compatibility with VS .NET 2005:
 * - in energy_function, modified use of pow to avoid ambiguity
 *
 * \version 3.30 (27 Oct 2006)
 * - defined class and associated data within "libcomm" namespace.
 * - removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
 * statements as needed.
 *
 * \version 3.31 (2 Jan 2008)
 * - modified stream output to include only LUT contents, not index
