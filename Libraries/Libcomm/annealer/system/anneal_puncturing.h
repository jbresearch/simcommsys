 * \brief   Simulated Annealing Puncturing Pattern Design.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * \version 1.00 (5 Jun 1999)
 * In this version, we load the contribution of each data and parity bit from a
 * file; then we try to create a turbo code with the smallest variance of
 * decoded-bit confidence. The restrictions are that we will be puncturing half
 * the bits of each parity sequence. We assume that initially we have a
 * rate-third code, and thus we will finish with a rate-half code. We also
 * assume binary code types and binary modulation for simplicity.
 *
 * \version 1.10 (11 Jun 1999)
 * Modified the algorithm by counting the variance of confidences produced by
 * *punctured* bits, and not by the unpunctured ones.
 *
 * \version 1.11 (4 Nov 2001)
 * added a stream output function in accordance with anneal_system 1.20
 *
 * \version 1.12 (1 Mar 2002)
 * edited the classes to be compileable with Microsoft extensions enabled - in
 * practice, the major change is in for() loops, where MS defines scope
 * differently from ANSI. Rather than taking the loop variables into function
 * scope, we chose to wrap around the offending for() loops.
 *
 * \version 1.13 (6 Mar 2002)
 * changed vcs version variable from a global to a static class variable.
 * also changed use of iostream from global to std namespace.
 *
 * \version 1.20 (27 Oct 2006)
 * - defined class and associated data within "libcomm" namespace.
 * - removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
 * statements as needed.
