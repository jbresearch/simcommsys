/*!
 * \brief   Communication System with Full-System Iteration.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * Communication system with iterative demodulation and decoding; the model here
 * is such that we demodulate once, then decode for M iterations. After that,
 * we pass the posterior information as prior information for a second
 * demodulation, followed again by M decoding iterations. This is repeated for
 * N demodulations (ie. full-system iterations), giving a total of N.M results.
 *
 * \note This only works with straight mapping for now.
 *
 * \todo Integrate this nature within updated commsys interface.
 *
 * \todo Update mapper interface as necessary to allow this to work with
 * non-straight mappers
