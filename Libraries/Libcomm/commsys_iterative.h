 * \brief   Communication System with Iterative Demodulation.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * Communication system with iterative demodulation (and possibly iterative
 * decoding); result set is for the given number of iterative demodulations
 * (say N) followed by iterative decoding. That is, result 1 will be for N
 * demodulations + 1 decoding iteration; result 2 is for N demodulations +
 * 2 decoding iter, etc.
 *
 * \todo Update interface to cater for various iterative modes between codec
 * and modem.
 *
 * \todo Move iterative codec nature into this class (requires codec split).
