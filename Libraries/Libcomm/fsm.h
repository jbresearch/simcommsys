    * By convention, lower index positions correspond to memory elements
    * nearer to the input side, and registers for lower-index inputs are
    * placed first
    *
    * Also, lower-order inputs get lower-order positions within the state
    * representation. Also, left-most memory elements (ie. those closest to
    * the input junction) are represented by lower index positions within
    * the state representation.
    *
    * Define the state vector as a column vector, as follows:
    * \f[ S_i = \begin{pmatrix}
    * S_{1,1} \\ S_{1,2} \\ \vdots \\ S_{1,k} \\
    * S_{2,1} \\ S_{2,2} \\ \vdots \\ S_{2,k} \\
    * \vdots \\ S_{\nu_k,k}
    * \end{pmatrix} \f]
    *
    * where \f$ k \f$ is the number of input lines and \f$ \nu_i \f$ is the
    * number of memory elements for input \f$ i \f$.
    * Element \f$ S_{1,i} \f$ is the left-most memory element for input
    * \f$ i \f$, and therefore the one to which the shift-in is applied.
    * It can be seen that the total length of the state vector is equal to
    * the total number of memory elements in the system, \f$ \nu \f$.
