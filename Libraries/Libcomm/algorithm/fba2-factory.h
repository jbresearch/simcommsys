 * \brief   Factory to return the desired Symbol-Level Forward-Backward

 * This factory automatically chooses between CPU and GPU implementations
 * depending on compiler flags, and takes as parameters the flag values
 * (which are determined at runtime).
 *
 * \tparam sig Channel symbol type
 * \tparam real Floating-point type for internal computation
 * \tparam real2 Floating-point type for receiver metric computation
