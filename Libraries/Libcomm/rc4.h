 * \brief   RSA RC4 Algorithm.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * \version 1.00 (03 Jul 2003)
 * initial version - class that implements RSA RC4 Algorithm, as specified in
 * Schneier, "Applied Cryptography", 1996, pp.397-398.
 *
 * \version 1.01 (04 Jul 2003)
 * changed vector tables to int8u instead of int, to ensure validity of values.
 *
 * \version 1.02 (5 Jul 2003)
 * - added self-testing on creation of the first object.
 * - modified counters to be int8u instead of int - also renamed them x & y
 * - removed superfluous mod 256 (& 0xff) operations
 *
 * \version 1.03 (17 Jul 2006)
 * in encrypt, changed the loop variable to type size_t, to avoid the warning
 * about comparisons between signed and unsigned types.
 *
 * \version 1.10 (6 Nov 2006)
 * - defined class and associated data within "libcomm" namespace.
 * - removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
 * statements as needed.
