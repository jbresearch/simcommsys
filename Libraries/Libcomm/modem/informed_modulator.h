/*!
 * \brief   Informed Modulator Interface.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * Defines common interface for informed blockmodem classes. An informed
 * blockmodem is one which can use a-priori symbol probabilities during the
 * demodulation stage. In general, such a blockmodem may be used in an iterative
 * loop with the channel codec.
 *
 * This interface is a superset of the regular blockmodem, defining two new
 * demodulation methods (atomic and vector) that make use of prior information.
 *
 * \todo Figure out whether atomic modem operations are really used anywhere
