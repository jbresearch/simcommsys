 * \brief   Stream-Oriented Modulator Interface.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * Defines common interface for stream-oriented blockmodem classes. A stream-
 * oriented blockmodem is one which can determine frame synchronization and
 * can make use of a-priori information for start and end of frame positions.
 * It is also an 'informed' modulator in that it can use a-priori symbol
 * probabilities during the demodulation stage. In general, such a blockmodem
 * is used with synchronization-correcting codes and can also be used in an
 * iterative loop with the channel codec. Such a blockmodem can also determine
 * posterior probabilities for the start and end of frame positions.
 *
 * This interface is a superset of the informed blockmodem, defining:
 * - Vector demodulation methods that make use of prior frame-edge information
 *   and support look-ahead
 * - A method to get the posterior channel drift pdf at codeword boundaries
 * - A method to get the positions of codeword boundaries
 * - A getter for the suggested look-ahead

     *                      (zero-index matches N-index of rx, where N is the
     *                      length of the transmitted frame + lookahead)
     * \param[in]  app      Prior probabilities of uncoded transmitted sequence
     * \param[out] ptable   Posterior probabilities of uncoded transmitted
     * sequence \param[out] sof_post Posterior probabilities for start-of-frame
     * position (zero-index matches zero-index of rx) \param[out] eof_post
     * Posterior probabilities for end-of-frame position (zero-index matches
     * N-index of rx, where N is the length of the transmitted frame) \param[in]
     * offset   Index offset for prior, post, and rx vectors
     *
     * \note To avoid the need for a container class that can take a non-zero
     *       index, the user needs to supply an offset value. This is needed for
     *       both prior and post containers as well as for the rx container.
     *       The offsets are defined in a positive way, so that the physical
     *       index is equal to the virtual index + offset.
     *
     * \todo Remove offset and replace vector types with ones that can take a
     *       non-zero index.
     *
     * \note \c ptable(i,d) \c is the posterior probability of having
     * transmitted symbol 'd' at time 'i'
     *
     * \note This function is non-const, to support time-variant modulation
     * schemes such as DM inner codes.
     *
     * \note app and ptable may point to the same space
     *
     * \note app may be empty; this should be taken to indicate that no prior
     * information is available
