 * \brief   Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel.
 * \author  Johann Briffa
 *
 * \version 1.10 (15 Apr 1999)
 * Changed the definition of set_snr to avoid using the pow() function.
 * This was causing an unexplained SEGV with optimised code
 *
 * \version 1.11 (6 Mar 2002)
 * changed vcs version variable from a global to a static class variable.
 *
 * \version 1.20 (13 Mar 2002)
 * updated the system to conform with the completed serialization protocol (in
 * conformance with channel 1.10), by adding the necessary name() function, and
 * also by adding a static serializer member and initialize it with this class's
 * name and the static constructor (adding that too). Also made the channel
 * object a public base class, rather than a virtual public one, since this was
 * affecting the transfer of virtual functions within the class (causing access
 * violations). Also moved most functions into the implementation file rather
 * than here.
 *
 * \version 1.30 (27 Mar 2002)
 * changed descriptive output function to conform with channel 1.30.
 *
 * \version 1.40 (30 Oct 2006)
 * - defined class and associated data within "libcomm" namespace.
 *
 * \version 1.50 (16 Oct 2007)
 * changed class to conform with channel 1.50.
 *
 * \version 1.51 (16 Oct 2007)
 * changed class to conform with channel 1.51.
 *
 * \version 1.52 (17 Oct 2007)
 * changed class to conform with channel 1.52.
 *
 * \version 1.53 (29 Oct 2007)
 * - updated clone() to return this object's type, rather than its base class
 * type. [cf. Stroustrup 15.6.2]
 *
 * \version 1.54 (24 Jan 2008)
 * - Changed derivation from channel to channel<sigspace>
