/*
   \version 1.10 (26 Feb 2002)
  noticed that the user messages were interfering with those of other classes.
  Started keeping track of user message allocation in a separate file in LibWin.

   \version 1.11 (7 Oct 2006)
  changed include fstream.h to fstream, and added usage of namespace std, to
  conform with modern library usage.

   \version 1.20 (6 Nov 2006)
   - defined class and associated data within "libwin" namespace.
   - removed pragma once directive, as this is unnecessary
   - changed unique define to conform with that used in other libraries
   - removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
  statements as needed.

   \version 1.21 (28 Nov 2007)
   - modifications to silence 64-bit portability warnings
    - changed type cast from int to UINT_PTR in Insert()
