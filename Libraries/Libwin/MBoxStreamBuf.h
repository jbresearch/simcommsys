/*
   \version 1.10 (29 Apr 2002)
  changed the meaning of \r: when a CR is received, it is translated into a
  newline _within_ the current mbox. A newline means as before (ie. output
  buffer into mbox)

   \version 1.20 (6 Nov 2006)
   - defined class and associated data within "libwin" namespace.
   - removed pragma once directive, as this is unnecessary
   - changed unique define to conform with that used in other libraries
   - removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
  statements as needed.
