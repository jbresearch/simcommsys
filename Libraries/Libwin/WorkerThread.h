/*
   \version 1.10 (15 Nov 2001)
  moved <afxmt.h> into StdAfx.h, and modified ThreadStart to allow choosing a
  priority for the worker thread. Also, it now defaults to ThreadPriorityLowest
  rather than BelowNormal. This was instroduced because it was slowing down some
  programs (notably FileSync).

   \version 1.11 (25 Feb 2002)
  made ThreadWorking() and ThreadInterrupted() inline functions by defining them
  within the class desciption below. Also removed the ThreadProc() empty
  function definition, making it pure virtual, so that derived classes now have
  to provide their own (this class is intended to be used that way anyway). Also
  solved a logical bug in the ThreadAskAndWait() function - the question should
  have been "do you want to FORCE the thread to finish" since we're going to
  wait for it to finish anyway.

   \version 1.20 (26 Feb 2002)
  Removed the AskAndWait function - the derived class should handle this itself
  based on the available functions. Added functions to Suspend, Resume, and Kill
  the worker thread - of these, Kill is still not working properly;

   \version 1.30 (6 Nov 2006)
   - defined class and associated data within "libwin" namespace.
   - removed pragma once directive, as this is unnecessary
   - changed unique define to conform with that used in other libraries
