   \version 1.10 (27 Nov 2001)
  added informative functions (image size/planes, tile size, number of tiles,
  etc)

   \version 1.20 (28 Nov 2001)
  made tile manipulation functions private. Derived classes should use the
  pre-defined plug-in interface routines to get the job done. Also re-directed
  'cerr' for all PSPlugIn-derived programs to MessageBox. Also moved progress
  indicator to TileWrite, so that the first call has a progress of zero - it
  seems that the first call is only really used to set up the indicator limits
  and does not really show up; progress is now also updated so that we count all
  tiles processed, not just the number of tile rows - this makes progress
  indicator work on a finer resolution. Also made most variables private.
  Derived classes should use the provided interfaces. Also added version
  specification for data block (if the allocated block does not match the
  required version, we re-allocate). This allows changes to the data block
  specification without reloading Photoshop.

   \version 1.30 (30 Nov 2001)
  added tile & total progress display functions.

   \version 1.31 (2 Dec 2001)
  added function to get ShowDialog flag - this is to allow user to call
  ShowDialog himself in FilterStart, allowing him to set up tiling information
  based on user info.

   \version 1.32 (3 Dec 2001)
  made pFilterRecord and pData as private members again - access to Photoshop
  info should be done through PSPlugIn functions only; Dialog classes can be
  passed a pointer to the PSPlugIn class rather than pFilterRecord and pData.
  Also added functions to set tile width / height, and made image & tile info
  functions public.

   \version 1.40 (5 Apr 2002)
  added protected functions to allow user to restart processing tile by tile.
  The first function IterationDone() returns true if all tiles have been
  processed in any given iteration (this should be called in FilterContinue only
  *after* the base FilterContinue has been called). The second function
  IterationStart() will set the next-tile to the first one, so that processing
  can start all over again. It is up to the user to call this in FilterContinue
  when it determines that the current iteration is done (by using
  IterationDone). It is also the user's responsibility to keep track of which
  iteration it is, and what needs to be done in this iteration. To make the
  user-interface neater, also modified the DisplayProgress functions to take two
  additional parameters - the current iteration (starting from zero) and the
  total number of iterations (which default to 0 and 1 respectively, so they can
  be safely ignored by single-pass operators). Actually these need not really be
  the true number of iterations, but only consider those iterations that are
  lengthy enough to require a progress operator. Also renamed TileReset to
  TileSetEmpty to more clearly indicate its function (this is a private member
  so it's safe to change). Also uncommented the informational output on current
  tile etc, and changed it to a TRACE function, so that progress can be
  monitored in debug builds.

   \version 1.41 (6 Apr 2002)
  removed automatic progress display from TileUpdate, since this would not work
  well in multi-pass filters. The user is requested to call one of the
  ProgressDisplay functions himself while processing the current tile. If only
  updated once, this should be done at the beginning of the tile processing, not
  at the end.

   \version 1.42 (7 Apr 2002)
  modified DisplayTileProgress to utilise DisplayTotalProgress for output (in
  order to centralize the code to compute the progress over several iterations).
  Also added protected functions that return current-tile coordinates for use in
  PSPlugIn or derived classes (may be used in filters that are space-variant);
  in the process, I also renamed the GetRealTileWidth and Height functions to
  GetCurrent... and moved them to protected access instead of public. They were
  not used except within this class so the move was painless. Finally, modified
  TileProgress to compute progress based on the number of pixels done/remaining,
  not number of tiles. Since not all tiles are of equal size (those at the edges
  are usually smaller), this change makes the progress indicator smoother. Also
  added default progress displays in FilterStart and FilterFinish, since these
  are safe and make the user interface neater (it ensures that the progress is
  reset initially and that it passes through 100% as soon as the filter is
  done). Note that this change allows the derived classes' tile progress display
  to be performed at any time during the cycle (ie removed the need for it to be
  at the start).

   \version 1.43 (7 Apr 2002)
  removed the member variable that keeps count of the number of calls to the
  plug-in. This was only used earlier for debugging purposes, to determine the
  calling convention for PhotoShop and particularly to determine when the plugin
  itself was reloaded.

   \version 1.44 (12 Apr 2002)
  updated tracing information (during TileWrite) so that the tile pixel ranges
  are both inclusive, and that current tile counts start from 1 rather than 0.
  Also, added trace information in most filter entry/exit points to help keep
  track of what is happening.

   \version 1.45 (12 Apr 2002)
  fixed a bug in FilterFinish, which was causing PhotoShop to complain about an
  error in the program; I was passing the timer duration as a string object
  (rather than a C-style string) to the TRACE operation. Also added a newline in
  that TRACE statement, which was missing.

   \version 1.46 (12 Apr 2002)
  fixed an obscure bug in SetPixelMatrix: when working with overlapped tiles, we
  do not really want to copy the whole tile back into the image, but only the
  central section. The exception is on the image borders, where we actually will
  be copying back data from the original image.

   \version 1.47 (29 Apr 2002)
  made DisplayProgress operations const functions - otherwise this would not
  allow their use in otherwise const classes.

   \version 1.48 (4 May 2002)
  fixed a bug that applies to 16-bit modes: in Photoshop it seems that the
  16-bit modes actually store pixels in the range 0->32768 rather than 0->32767
  as I thought (or 0->65535 as they should!). This was noted by L. Chang in an
  email to the SDK mailing list and confirmed by Tom Ruark on 05/02/02. Note
  also that this class converts from integers to floating point and vice versa
  only by multiplication or division - no boolean operations are performed; this
  allows the derived plugins to manipulate beyond the boundary if necessary.
  Also modified the conversion from double to int (for 8 & 16-bit) to do a
  rounding operation rather than straight conversion (which might truncate
  data).

   \version 1.50 (1 Nov 2002)
  added functions for scripting support - since pFilterRecord was made private
  in version 1.32, derived classes need a way to access the Descriptor Suite.
  The parameters are read from scripting during FilterStart, and written back
  during FilterFinish; also made GetShowDialog a const member.

   \version 1.51 (2 Nov 2002)
  added more functions for scripting support - in order to simplify
  reading/writing of descriptor key/value pairs, we added functions to do so,
  and convert between STL or MFC types (which we usually use) and the Adobe SDK
  types required by the scripting system; also changed low-level scripting
  routines to private, and made low-level read/write script parameters
  non-virtual.

   \version 1.52 (8 Nov 2002)
  added Main function which contains the standard PluginMain routine for filter
  plugins - this reduces the amount of copying between different plugins and
  ensures better uniformity.

   \version 1.53 (8 Nov 2002)
  bug fix: moved memory allocation for data block to a new private function,
  which is now called from both FilterPrepare and FilterParameters, as
  necessary, since the latter isn't called when the filter is invoked through
  the scripting system. Thus, if the filter is invoked through scripting without
  first being invoked (at least once) directly by the user, then memory would
  never be allocated, causing an error.

   \version 1.54 (12 Nov 2002)
  added tracing for read/write script parameters and data allocation; removed
  data allocation from FilterParameters, since it is totally redundant there.

   \version 1.55 (19 Feb 2003)
  added definition for DLLExport - this was previously being taken from
  PIDefines, which is part of the SDK sample code and not of the API itself.
  This removes all need for including files from the sample code.

   \version 1.60 (6 Nov 2006)
   - defined class and associated data within "libwin" namespace.
   - removed pragma once directive, as this is unnecessary
   - changed unique define to conform with that used in other libraries
   - removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
  statements as needed.

   \version 1.61 (10 Nov 2006)
   - made class a derivative of CRoutedIO.

   \version 1.62 (7 Nov 2007)
   - moved Adobe SDK includes here from stdafx.h.
   - made this module compile only when ADOBESDK is defined.
