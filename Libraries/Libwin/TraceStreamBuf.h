/*
   \version 1.10 (6 Nov 2006)
   - defined class and associated data within "libwin" namespace.
   - removed pragma once directive, as this is unnecessary
   - changed unique define to conform with that used in other libraries
   - removed use of "using namespace std", replacing by tighter "using"
   statements as needed.
